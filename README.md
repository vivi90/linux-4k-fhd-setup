# 4K-FHD xrandr and xinput shell scripts for Linux
This repository is an collection of my xrandr shell scripts to use full hd monitors (1080p) in combination with my ultra hd notebook display.
It also maps the pen of an graphic tablet to one of the monitor(s) or the internal display.

## Usage
Please use at first `xrandr` to check the name of your display and monitor(s).
Then check also the output of `xinput` to determine the ID of your graphic tablet pen.
The files are named, how the display and monitor(s) are configured.
